## Welcome to CoActionOS

CoActionOS is a real-time, embedded operating system for the ARM Cortex-M3 architecture. It features:

* Easy-to-learn, POSIX Style API
* A multi-tasking, pre-emptive kernel
* Filesystems (including peripheral and device level hardware abstraction)
* A USB user interface with a cross-platform desktop software application and SDK

## Getting Started

CoActionOS is designed for maximum ease of use.  Unlike other microcontroller RTOS's, 
you don't have to integrate your application with the operating system.  
You just compile your application using the free SDK and install it on any system running CoActionOS.
